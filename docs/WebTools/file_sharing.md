## Private Note Sharing

:::warning
 Private Note Sharing is a scam, don't use them. Use an E2E secure messaging app to begin with.
 - You can't trust the encryption unless you have checked the code yourself.
 - You don't know if they are stroring the data.
 - You don't know if the "single use" is true.
 - It is no different from encrypting files you upload to normal cloud storage.
